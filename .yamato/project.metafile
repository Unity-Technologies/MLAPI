# The small agent was created to handle jobs that don't involve running Unity (for example pack job).
# It uses ubuntu since Linux VMs are faster and cheaper to provision than Mac or Windows Virtual Machines (VMs).
# The b1.small flavour is nearly always sufficient for jobs that donâ€™t involve running Unity Editor.
