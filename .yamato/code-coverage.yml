  # This setup performs build-only validation since WebGL runs in browser and for tests to be executed we would need to 
  # consider having a web server, browser automation and overall complex test setup.
  # Default project (testptoject) in this case is used as a context.
  # WebGL requires Il2cpp scripting backend so mono is not considered
  # ARM64 architectures are not considered since Windows_arm64 is recommended to use only after builds and when it comes to macOS_arm64 there is problem with OpenCL not being available
  # Builds are made on each desktop platform as in project.metafile declaration
    
# Runs package tests in order to determine code coverage of the NGO package.
# In essence it's performing the same task as .yamato/package-test jobs with the overhead being the measured code coverage
# It's ok for code coverage to be performed only on one platform (default) since code coverage won't change much between those.
# Default platform was chosen (ubuntu) since it's the fastest and most resource friendly with default editor.
